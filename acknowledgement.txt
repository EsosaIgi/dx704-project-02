Acknowledgement

Per Part 6, I am providing a brief written statement about my process and any tools used.
I used generative AI tools to understand the assignment requirements and to help structure
and implement the steps needed to create the required files. Specifically, I used generative
AI to understand and effectively make the backtest file (strawberry-backtest.tsv) and the
forecast file (strawberry-forecast.tsv). I reviewed and executed the code myself and accept
responsibility for the submitted work.
